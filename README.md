# maze-game

I created this repository to house my code i created for this maze game.
thsi project mainly uses javascript with some hand in hand help from kabook.js
kaboom is a javascript library which is there to help with spinning up new games very easily and quickly.
Kaboom helps simplify creating scenes, adding layers, importing sprites, dealing with actions and events, keyboard events, debugging and more.


this project is a part of a compulsory project i must complete for my apprentiship inoorder to enter final gate way.
